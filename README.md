# OmegaBot 2
Public repo of OmegaBot 2. Please see license.
# Compilation
Debug and compilation batch files for windows compilation. Requires rust and QT version 5.15.2 (32 bit) and cbindgen. When asked for count frames answer yes/no, it enables/disables the count frames feature which is an alternative way of counting frames. See source for further info.
# Pull Requests
Use cargo clippy and make sure there are no errors for the rust code. For C++ code, minimise errors and use descriptive variable names. I will most likely edit pull requests anyway.
